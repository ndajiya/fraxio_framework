            <p>Fractio is a platform that allows you to easily make dynamic digital art that evolves and reacts to the real world.
            Our goal is to remove the boundaries that limit what you can work with. When art and information integrate, the limits become only your imagination.
            A painting of a tropical seascape that displays the sunrise and sunset in Maui in real time; A rocketship that blasts off to the moon when a crypto 
            token hits a certain price; Music that automatically adds different instrumental tracks to be more and more upbeat as your favorite team scores goals. 
            Fractio makes creations like these possible without needing to write any code whatsoever, letting you focus on your vision for the piece.
