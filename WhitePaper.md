# Tokenomics

## MILK Token [MLK] ERC20

The Milk Token is Fractio's Governance and Cash Token 
for the entire Fractio Framework. The Plan is to peg it 
to a DAO goverened Formula to stabilize the MLK Price in
order to provide reliable Price structures. The MLK
Token is based on the ERC20 Token Standard and utilizes 
Chainlink Oracles and Governance Proposals as Input
Parameters for the embedded stabizing function FR-72981

There are several use Cases for MLK on our Platform.
MLK is used to create PYE Tokens, it is used to split
your PYE Tokens to FRX Tokens, it is used for creating
a Milk Pool "Milquidity" and can be used to create 
Polls and Proposals and also for Voting.

The Token Supply is fixed to a maximum amount of 
27 Billion MLK Tokens the Tokens are to be spread
through Multiple Ethereum Sidechains and the Mainnet
with bridge Contracts. 

The Contract Safe will keep 5 Billion MLK Tokens locked 
until all other Tokens have been minted and distributed.
It will be used as a Liquidity Pool against the Mint Event
Income to enable MLK trading on our Framework in both 
directions.

Every Mint Event will release the MLK Tokens to 
all ME Participants they will be distributed evenly
after the Target Sale Price of 50 Million USD has
been reached. 
```
Mint Events:
The first Mint event is on the Ethereum Mainnet
and planned for the Q3 2021

The second Mint Event is on the xDai Ethereum Sidechain
and planned for Q4 2021

The third Mint Event is on AVAX Ethereum Sidechain
and planned for Q2 2021
```

```
The Distribution Scheme of the MLK Tokens:
7 Billion operational recources
5 Billion first Public Mint Event
5 Billion second Public Milk Event
5 Billion third Public Milk Event
5 Billion final Mint Event
```

## PYE Token [PYE] ERC721

The PYE token is a multilayer interactive token
it utilizes layer technology, verifiable andomness,
Real Time Oracle Data Feeds and Real Time Data Feeds
to generate interactive Audio Visual Tokens that can 
animate single layers to Data Feed Triggers or even 
trigger external SmartContract functions on the 
Blockchain.

The use cases for the PYE Token are close to unlimited.

The token Supply is also unlimited and users of the 
Fractio Framework can Mint PYE Tokens at any Time.

Minting the Token requires MLK Tokens and Network Fees. 

```
Costs:
10 MLK per Layer
50 MLK per external function trigger
10 MLK per draft save
50 MLK per mint
+ Network Fees
```

```
Example:
A PYE Token with 3 Layers and 1 external function 
trigger costs 130 MLK + networf feesif not draft saved.

A PYE Token with 1 Layer costs 70 MLK + network fees 
if not draft saved.

A PYE Token with 1 Layer costs 80 MLK + network fees 
if once draft saved.
```

## Fractio Token [FRX] ERC20

Fractio Tokens [FRX] are fractionized PYE Tokens.
The PYE Token ERC721 Standard is unique and has to be 
locked into the Fractionizer Contract FR-81369.
The FRX Token ERC20 Standard has a fixed amount the 
user customizes after he locks his PYE into the 
FRX Asset Class.

Every FRX Asset Class has its own Contract Address,
Token Name (MyPyeTokenName) and Symbol [FRX_MPTN]
and gets minted onto the creators address.

The FRX Tokens each represent a Fraction of the
Parent PYE Token. FRX tokens are Fungible Tokens
that are tied to the Non Fungible Value of a parent 
PYE Token. If the creator decides to mint 100 FRX
total supply from his Parent PYE every FRX will be 
worth 1/100 Parent PYE. The supply of specific
FRX tokens is fixed.

```
Example:

PYE_alpha gets locked at a ratio 1:1000 and returns 1000 FRX_alpha each worth 1/1000 PYE_alpha
```

When the value of the Parent PYE Token changes the 
value of the FRX Token changes Proportianlly

The locking of PYE and minting of FRX requires 
MLK Tokens and Network Fees.

```
Costs:

100 MLK for Locking PYE and Fractionizing
+ Network Fees
```

## Milquidity MLK Pools

In order to swap FRX tokens in a decentral Fashion 
Fractio Framework offers its users to provide Milquidity
by supplying MLK Tokens and FRX Tokens to a MLK Pool.
