# Philosophy

## Public Onboarding

Fractio's target audience are commercial users, private users, 
celebrities and organisations that produce digital media. 
Our Framework enables them to utilize web3 technology and 
create digital asset classes on the blockchain without 
coding knowledge.  

## Use Case Launchpad

Our Framework empowers users to create digital asset classes
that will revolutionize existing standards and develop one 
that doesn't exist yet. 

## Ethos

decentralized, fair & autonomous

# Tokenomics

## PYE Token [PYE] ERC721
<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmevQwvrszQX4eHa7v4QR9JphGGgDttmnUZ32Qm7VYLTNB" height="120px" />

Using the native editor on the Fractio platform, users can create non-fungible, multilayer, interactive digital assets called PYE tokens. Real-time oracle data feeds and verifiable randomness are easily integrated into the token, so users are able to generate audio/visual assets that can react to, or even trigger, real world events. The layer editor makes this all possible without the need for code from the end user.

<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcAcDpHCSSFNYd8HT4UxTjrTD9hZgymTDomvg1U8LxGft" height="120px" />

The use cases for the PYE Token are nearly unlimited. A simple example is NFT artwork that changes the image displayed based upon the market price of a crypto asset such as bitcoin.
Users of the Fractio framework can mint PYE tokens at any time. 
Minting the PYE token requires platform fees in the form of Milq tokens (MLQ) and network fees.


## Milq Token [MLQ] ERC20
<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecBrFU35A8R7eXVAE7QeNFv14nzk12DtnccVKJgzKjHA" height="120px" />

The Milk Token (MLQ) is Fractio’s utility token, and is used in every aspect of the framework. MLQ is needed to:
Utilize the layer editor to create and mint PYE tokens
Buy or trade PYE tokens
Fractionize PYE tokens into FRX and participate in liquidity pools.

The token supply is fixed to a maximum amount of 27 billion MLQ tokens - 
the tokens are to be spread through the Ethereum mainnet and multiple sidechains 
using bridge contracts. The initial price of 1 MLQ token will be the ~0.01 Dai 
equivalent in ETH. The contract safe will keep 5 Billion MLQ tokens locked until all other tokens 
have been minted and distributed. It will be used as a liquidity pool against 
the Mint Event income to enable the trading of tokens on our framework.
Every Mint Event will release the MLQ tokens to all participants.

Planned Mint Events:
Ethereum Mainnet
xDai Ethereum Sidechain
AVAX, Polygon, or other Ethereum Sidechains

## Fractio Token [FRX] ERC20
<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV8uLnmjKJvAThn6b3EqrQcBwKtNjsWXCZ32qxdQsXgVu" height="120px" />

Using Fractio’s “Fractionizer” contract (FR-81369), users can lock their unique ERC-721 standard PYE token and create any specified number or FRX tokens, each one representative of an equal portion of the parent PYE token. FRX tokens conform to the ERC-20 standard and have a fixed amount that the user customizes when they lock their PYE into the contract. 

<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTaPAkCfxNk94QTuTbShiywS2o81q6V3isHxgC2DUwgSM" height="120px" />

FRX tokens are fungible tokens that are tied to the non-fungible value of a parent PYE token. If the creator decides to fractionize their parent PYE into 100 FRX tokens, each FRX will be representative of 1/100th of the parent PYE. The supply of specific FRX tokens is fixed, as determined at the time the parent PYE is locked into the fractionizer contract.
Each FRX asset class has its own contract address, token name (MyPyeTokenName) and Symbol [FRX_MPTN], and gets minted onto the creator's address.
Example:

PYE_alpha gets locked at a ratio of 1:1000 
and returns 1000 FRX_alpha, each representing
1/1000th of PYE_alpha

When the value of the parent PYE token changes, the value of the FRX token changes proportionally. Locking PYE to mint FRX requires MLQ tokens and network fees.
Example Costs:

100 MLQ for locking
and fractionizing PYE 
+ Network Fees

## Milquidity Pools [MLQP] ERC20
<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY1UxSmJFS3WgRX7pFckxYxGqbpGfiPii1QEFUffA5da4" height="120px" />

Fractio will have multiple liquidity pools that support the overall ecosystem.
In order to facilitate swapping between the aforementioned PYE, MLK, and FRX tokens in a decentralized fashion, users may provide “Milquidity” to a pool (MLQP). MLQP's can be run as regular swapping pools or as bid-auction pools, and are entirely customizable.
In order to facilitate the purchase of MLQ tokens, users may also provide liquidity in pairs of MLQ-ETH or MLQ-DAI. Users who lock their Milquidity in these pools will receive compensation in the form of Milq Shake tokens (SHK).

## Milq Shake Tokens [SHK] ERC20
<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYkPDkpHTHMRodNhwnjyEm4KfDt4LTPLiFsK7QVdogM22" height="120px" />

Milq Shake tokens (SHK) are the share token of the Fractio framework. They are earned by staking in the MLQP pools for a minimum of  1 up to 5 cycles. Holders of SHK will be eligible to receive a share of the revenues generated by Fractio. 
The MLQP tokens that are frozen in the stake contract are partly “deepfrozen” (not withdrawable until the end of the cycle) and “meltable” (withdrawable at any time). The same process also applies to the SHK tokens the user can claim from 
the revenue stream. 

Formulas: 

the locked milquidity = LM
the locked revenue = LR
the torque factor = TF [range: 4-6]
the cycle length = CL [range: 6-18 months]
amount of locked cycles = LC [range: 1-5 cycles]

+ LM = 100 / (TF * (LC / (CL / 10)))
+ LR = 80 / (TF / LC) + (CL - 6)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F_0-w1Kt4dx7M4xnyzCXMDIF0SEs-4hzT2zEruNUvU8/edit?usp=sharing


The Total Supply of SHK is fixed at 1618033 SHK Tokens the initial value of the Token is 12.50 Dai.


# Organizational Structure

## Core Team

+ Chief Digital Architect - Aron Ayuk  
+ Social Media Engineer - Daniel Poblano
+ Business & Marketing Strategist - Irvin Chen
+ Technical Community Manager - Louell Sala
+ Operational Security Manager - Nathan Misner

## Core Concept

The Fractio Framework enables users without coding 
experience to create interactive digital assets 
of any shape and size using the PYE Editor .
The use of Multilayers, Oracles, APIs and Actions
triggered by Real Time Events are easy to integrate
into the Tokens. The ability to fractionize 
Non Fungible PYE Tokens (ERC721) into FRX Tokens (ERC20) enables  
users to create splittable dynamic assets that can
unlock data inside the parent PYE Token for all child FRX holders.


## The Launch Plans

+ Test Net Launch [active]
  We are creating the core contracts and the frontend 
  of the framework on the rinkeby testnet as sandbox
  environment. All chain internal functions are 
  thouroughly tested and audited before mainnet launches.

+ Artist & Designer Workshops [coming soon]
  Physical and Online Workshops will teach creatives how to utilize the fractio
  framework for their purposes. The creatives can participate in the initial 
  PYE token competition.

+ Core Mint [planned mid Q3]
  The core mint is the initial minting ceremony of the 
  first 7 Billion MLQ tokens and the entire SHK supply of 1618033 Million Tokens.
  The tokens are the neccessary Collateral for the Main Milquidity Pools.

+ Private Mint
  5 Billion MLQ tokens will be minted and sold to early adopters of the Fractio Framework.  

+ Public Premint
  1 Billion MLQ_IOU tokens will be auctioned to the broad public before the staking launches on mainnet.
  
+ Ethereum Mainnet Launch
  The Fractio Framework launches on the Ethereum mainnet and allows users to create milquidity pools on mainnet.

+ PYE Token competition
  Creatives compete against each other creating the most exciting interactive PYE token. The tokens 
  created in this competition are going to be the first PYE tokens minted on the mainnet in history.

+ Public Mint
  The day before the first PYEs are being auctioned on the market the public mint event will take place
  MLQ_IOU will be exchanged to MLQ and the Main Milquidity Pools will be open to the public.
  
+ Marketplace Launch 
  The first Tokens to be swapped on our Marketplace are the ones from the PYE Token competition.
  They will be auctioned to the public in a 24 h auction. After the Auction closes the public will
  be able to mint PYE tokens from our editor.

+ Crosschain VRF Launch
  In order to verify that tokens do not already exist on another chain we are developing the 
  crosschain vrf analyzer that makes sure that tokens can only exist once on all chains Fractio uses.
  
+ Private Premint
  1 Billion MLQ_IOU tokens will be auctioned to the early adopters before the xDai launch.
  
+ xDai Mainnet Launch
  The Fractio Framework launches on the xDai mainnet and allows users to create PYE Tokens.
  It automatically verifies that the tokens are globally unique.
  
+ Public Mint
  The day before the first PYEs are being auctioned on the market the public mint event will take place
  MLQ_IOU will be exchanged to MLQ and the Main Milquidity Pools will be open to the public.
  
+ Bridge Launch
  The bridge allows users to move the PYE tokens they own from on chain to another. 

+ Airdrop Uno 
  500 Million MLQ Tokens + 50000 FRX Tokns will be distributed to frequent users. 


## Projects

Artist workshops for Mainnet Mint Event Token Auction.
These workshops are part of our launch campaign. The 
goal is to teach chosen artists how to use and create
digital asset classes on the Fractio Framework. The 
artworks these artist have created will then be auctioned
on the Mainnet Minting Event.

Video Workshops are another tool to onboard artist 
to the Mainnet Mint Event Token Auction and are the 
digital approach to our Workshops.

We are planning to participate in NFT Conventions to
showcase the advantages of the Fractio Framework and 
onboard users to our platform.

# Technologies 

## Ethereum Blockchain

Fractio is utilizing Ethereum blockchain technology 
and can theoretically be deployed on any Ethereum 
sidechain that has a running Chainlink Oracle and 
VRF node. The smart contract language that Fractio
uses is Solidity and because Fractio is a DAO, the main 
focus on the selection of our chains is decentralization.
Private smart contract chains (Binance Smart Chain for example)
are incompatible with our decentralized ethos.

## IPFS

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) helps Fractio
store PYE Token data in a decentralized manner. It
also provides a faster and more efficient network
infrastructure for our project. 

Every user will have his own IPFS authorizable directory on 
a Fractio IPFS Node and authorizable subdirectories for every 
PYE Token. 

We are planning to build an entirely new approach
of a pinning mechanism that lets users pin data 
by liking, buying, or commenting on PYE Tokens.

## Filecoin

Fractio is soon launching a Filecoin node to 
support the IPFS infrastructure we are building
by storing the files on our node and creating
a DAO-governed file storage network

## The Graph

The PYE token, FRX token, MLK token, and
MLQ Pool each get their own subGraph hosted
on theGraph. It enables Fractio to utilize 
the GraphQL database structure in a decentralized 
manner that saves large amounts of time and 
energy and enables much faster and more efficient 
search queries.

## Chainlink

Chainlink provides Fractio with real-world oracle
data and verifiable randomness, when needed. The team met
at the Spring 2021 Chainlink Hackathon and came
up with an idea that grew into this project.

# Use Cases 

## Dynamic Art

The PYE Editor is a way to allow artists, designers, 
and all types of creatives to design new forms of 
digital art.

<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcbfMjGoJ4iLCVK2Zc6M2fPj9c5Fj6hwwfDcVLNDYFAoq" height="120px" />

The tokens can interact with oracle information reflecting 
live real world data. Futhermore, we can add verifiable random 
data to each layer making each PYE token completely unique.

## Advertisement

The PYE Token can be utilized for unique advertisement experiences
such as dynamic bonuses that can react to real time sales data and 
update the display automatically.
```
Example:
The PYE Token displays a bonus of 50% for the first buyer, the 
next buyer gets 49% displayed and they decrement for every following 
buyer at a fixed rate per buyer
```


This could incentivize customers to buy products quicker if they are 
holder of the Dynamic Bonus PYE Token 

## Sport Bets

The PYE Token can be used for betting by creating 2 PYE tokens and anchoring 
them into a PYE bet contract. Depending on the game's outcome, the winning PYE 
token holder will then receive the prize pool. Event results can be displayed 
on the token and event scores can be used to trigger animations.

```
Example:
There is a UFC Fight and 2 PYE tokens (1 for 
each fighter) were fractionized to 1 million 
tokens each. The token sale can determine the 
betting odds, or oracle odds can be included. 
The holders of the winning token share the 
prize pool.
```
<img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQDbqptkodNryYU9ART8soQE5dGAcyYwurMzJQxxWF4gH" height="120px" />

## Trading Signals

The PYE token can be utilized as a trading signal token that acquires real-time
oracle data and transforms chosen price feeds into visual output of
buying and selling opportunities on a chosen currency pair. It can even
trigger external functions and perform a transaction if approved.



## NFT Games

The NFT Gaming Space can utilize all types of digital interactive assets.
Players rank, health, levels, items and other assets can all be stored 
and visualized as a PYE Asset, and even display real-time game data or 
real-word oracle data.

## Collectibles

Sports trading cards are a good example how real-world data can be utilized
in collectibles. An athlete's image and stats can simply be pegged to 
real-world sports result feeds. It could also display his/her latest 
post on social media.

## Memes 

The Blockchain space has a deeply rooted meme culture attached to it. Some 
memes are so ubiquitous that they are simply priceless. Memes are going to 
come alive with the PYE token and can be fed with external data feeds 
to keep the meme burning hot.

``` 
Example:
There is a meme of a celebrity and his 
last tweet gets displayed in a speech bubble.
```

## Music Albums

The Pye Token can be utilized as music medium. It secures your media and only
makes it accessible to owners of the child FRX Token. It can display videos
and store .wav and .aiff quality sound formats. The data you upload is immutable
and its access restricted exactly like the token. You can add programmable 
functionalities to the album that react to real time data.

```
Example:
A musician can release his album with an hidden 
track that only gets released after a certain 
amount of sales.
```

## Weather Insurance 

PYE Weather Insurance Tokens are able to display read 
information for specific locations utilizing real time 
weather data. The token could send out warnings in case of 
approaching dangerous climate changes and for example help 
insurances set their rates.


## Activity Maps

PYE activity maps can visualize any type of data stream (for 
example, metadata of a group of tokenholders), and render a map
of their specified activity.

```
Example:
A Hackathon takes place and every user gets a token - this 
token reads out the github repo activity data of all users
and creates a heatmap of wich team was most productive 
in deployments, codechanges, or lines of code.
```

## Event Tokens

PYE event tokens can be used as Proof of Participation, 
as Proof of Authorization or as Proof of Authentification
Token. Whenever a real-life event occurs, the PYE Event 
Token can be utilized as ticket area Pass and Participation
Protocol.

## Geo Based Tokens

The PYE framework is able to render maps of geopositions - if 
authorized, it can render the geopositions of tokenholders 
onto a map or display the users geodata.
